<p>Anyone who knows me well knows that I really enjoy music. Having been inspired by Utah Symphony concerts and amazed at the sounds you could produce out of a violin, I was encouraged to <a href="http://alcheng.scripts.mit.edu/2018/10/14/musical-musings/">start my musical journey with piano</a>. I ended up spending nearly 12 fantastic years on the black and white keys, with a brief period of time in middle school learning the cello that satisfied my interest in string instruments. In college, though, I figured with MIT’s heavy class load and the unfortunate immobility of a full piano that it would be infeasible for me to continue my two-plus hour a day practice schedule.</p>
<p>I did know, however, that there were other musical opportunities on campus. A cappella – the art of choral arrangement, often updated for modern songs – epitomizes the college experience: bring together a group of about twenty folks from different living groups, majors, and interests, and get them to perform for no other reason than to show off to friends and truly enjoy music. My younger brother had actually introduced me to the concept a few years earlier through the show “The Sing Off”. Amazing groups like <a href="https://youtu.be/yhTh6BqK6Nw?t=96">Pentatonix</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YSRRI7rmMU">Home Free</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZF__07gak8">Filharmonic</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ4df2xprfA">Ten</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_csO1qC6uE">VoicePlay</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--IXEDVq4fs">Vocal Rush</a> were huge in showing me the awesomeness of a cappella.</p>

<p>I was particularly inspired by Kyana Fanene, the beatboxer for Vocal Rush, the group from the Oakland School from the Arts. Seeing that someone my age could learn how to beatbox so well (as well as another friend who showed off his sweet skills – shoutout to Dezhane!) inspired me to learn the techniques myself. I figured that, even if I was not a good singer, I could find a group for myself with those skills and learn the singing parts along the way. Though the YouTube video series no longer exists, I must give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8j8j0DR0d8WKM7QCfN22WQ">KRNFX</a> and his collaboration with Maker Studios for putting me on that path.</p>
<p>When I got onto campus, however, I found getting into a group was not as easy as I thought. Unlike nearly all groups I’d heard about before, at MIT, none of the 11 (!) groups had a dedicated beatboxer (“vocal percussion”) position. I found this out the hard way through my auditions – trying out for the most serious groups on campus like the Chorallaries (who compete in the <a href="https://varsityvocals.com/events/category/icca/">ICCAs</a>) and Logarhythms (a famously 15+ hour per week commitment) showed me I was quite unprepared. While I made it through to two group’s “callbacks” out of four groups I auditioned for, my skills vocally were not strong enough to make it through as a member of the group. I distinctly remember being given a part with just one middle G on the first beat of each measure, and painfully not being able to consistently hit that one note at all through the entirety of the callback.</p>
<p>Thus, I started freshman fall not being able to participate in the one extracurricular I was most excited about being a part of in college. I tried playing piano with some of the extra time I had, but the time crunch rang true: without weekly practices and looming competitions, it was hard to justify putting multiple hours a day when there were other things to learn and take care of.</p>
<p>Freshman spring, I took a more relaxed approach to auditions. I figured that any experience would be a good one, given my relative lack of singing ability and the fact that I was just looking for a group to musically jive with. With my luck, I was able to get into the MIT <a href="http://centrifugues.mit.edu/">Centrifugues</a> and MIT-Wellesley Toons, the first two auditions I did that semester. The Toons seemed like a lovely bunch, but they split time practicing on both campuses, so I figured the Fugues (also a lovely bunch of people) would be a great opportunity to finally get the a cappella experience I wanted. Though I had gotten callbacks offers from other groups, at this point, I was happy enough getting into a group, and decided to move forward.</p>

<p>In the Fugues, I sang baritone and did vocal percussion/beatboxing (as seen above; you have been forewarned that I did not know what hair product was at the time). It was indeed a great experience, and I learned so much about how to sing, blend, move, and practice as part of a group. I want to give huge shoutouts to Edward Nguyen, Daniel Gonzalez, and Dustin Doss for the huge learnings and lessons I took from them during my time in the group.</p>
<p>The Centrifugues, as the name somewhat implies, focuses on all songs being mashups or medleys, with few exceptions. While it was a great way to get a crash course on many types of music, I found myself realizing that it wasn’t exactly what I was hoping for musically. Looking back now with the power of hindsight, my time in the group was spent on the less on the musicality of the group as a whole and more on trying to learning to fit parts together from different songs. The fact that all of our songs were mashups or medleys meant that instead of learning 8 to 10 songs like most other groups in a semester, we were effectively learning double or more that amount, which made it challenging as the Fugues were known to have a bit lower of a time commitment than other groups on campus. Additionally, with all due respect to the members of the group, since I was the only one coming in with vocal percussion experience, it was challenging figuring out what was appropriate and actually sounded good in the context of a cappella. These factors made me become less attracted to the group’s mission from my interests and desires, in spite of the excellent group of folks in the group itself.</p>
<p>After much internal turmoil and discussion with folks in the Fugues, I decided to leave the group in search of a better fit. I re-auditioned with a primary focus of getting into groups that fit my interest in modern pop and R&B. Unfortunately, though I made it to a few callbacks yet again, I wasn’t able to crack into any group, and my time beginning in the Materials Science and Engineering major swallowed me up whole for the rest of sophomore year. While I put together another attempt to audition for a few groups in Junior fall, having continued to improve as a vocalist and continuing to enjoy a cappella music, my workload prevented me from seriously training and working on my singing abilities to the point where I was a can’t miss candidate. It should also be noted there were probably some factors at play that were out of my control – some groups already had a lot of folks with baritone/tenor ranges, vocal percussion skills, or simply people in my year and thus didn’t need the skillset I had / wanted to prevent too much of the group graduating at one time. But, after not making it into a group I really wanted for the third fall running, I was ready to give up on my now-fading dreams of doing a cappella in college.</p>

<p>Junior Spring, I received an email about <em>Next Sing</em>, a new concept. It sounded really interesting – offering a lower time commitment and the opportunity to focus on the music each act lead really wanted to do. I found it to be the perfect opportunity to explore the music I wanted to do and become the captain of my own musical journey. Thus, I’ve spent the last two semesters (Spring and Fall 2019) as an act lead for Next Sing, getting to explore all sorts of music, learn from others’ arrangements, and even make some of my own. Last semester, I was the act lead for covers of two amazing arrangements: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VIQUMjq_p8">Kids</a> by OneRepublic, as arranged by Vocalight, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQwHVjHxpx8">Way Back Home</a> by Shaun (a K-pop song), as arranged by Marveluss. This semester, I made three original arrangements of Isn’t She Lovely (heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCDXJbA2YjI">this</a> great arrangement) by Stevie Wonder, Colors of the Wind (the Disney classic), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNiI84v1u20">The Way I Do</a>, by Bishop Briggs. I had even made two other arrangements of Sam Smith’s new single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmYypVozQb4">How Do You Sleep</a>, and the modern K-Pop classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9IxdwEFk1c">Palette</a>, by IU, which unfortunately did not make it through to the concert this fall. Yet on the whole, Next Sing has truly allowed me to work with people passionate about music who, like myself, have limited extra time at MIT and are looking for specific types of music they enjoy listening to and emulating. These sort of innovative projects and opportunities to build something new are exactly what makes the MIT community so cool and lively. I look forward to Next Sing in the remaining time I have here at the institute.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m not exactly sure what this concert theme is either.</p>
<hr><p>These (almost) four years of a cappella here at MIT have taught me a lot about music, but also a lot about myself.</p>
<p>A huge learning point was to never go half-assed into anything, and instead go full-assed on everything that worth caring about, even if it was something that on the surface didn’t need to much preparation for. My freshman fall, I was balancing rushing fraternities with auditions, which was really hard given the very socially intense activities, in new contexts, that both turned out to be. I knew I had the skills of one of the top beatboxers on campus, yet I never prepared a showcase in auditions in spite of learning after my first round of auditions that most groups expected one, figuring I could skate by on my talent and spontaneity. If I truly really wanted to get into a cappella, in the context of MIT, I should have tried harder to work on my abilities vocally so I could have made it into a group I wanted to sophomore fall, or done more due diligence freshman spring to make sure the group I was joining truly was the musical fit for me rather than just being happy that I was accepted. Of course, a lot of this is circumstantial and with the knowledge of hindsight, but the adage of whole-assing one thing is something I’ve carried forward today in many other aspects of my life.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned was not to put too many expectations on myself without getting a perspective of the whole situation. Oftentimes I thought something along the lines of “Wow, look at how far you’ve come! They have to take you now!” where in reality, even if I were amazing, there isn’t really a need for a group to have five tenors and two basses, or ten 2020 graduates and two 2021s. If I were to try to force myself into a group where the fit wasn’t great, I needed to be exponentially better than anyone who already proved themselves, which is something I just hadn’t put enough effort into. On that note, practicing a little bit every day, either new vocal percussion patterns or getting confidence to sing higher notes (especially in public) showed me the true value of incremental exponential growth – you can become much much better at something if you just spend a little time every day. While this is something I’m still trying to improve on (working on stabilizing making my sleep and workout schedules, writing in this blog, reading about my professional interests), a cappella has showed me that consistency over time will always provide for better long-term results. In particular, consistent, mindful action will continue to lead to fulfillment rather putting those expectations on others and crashing when they can’t fulfill personal desire.</p>
<p>On the whole, the primary takeaway has been that there is always an opportunity to do what you love as long as you keep searching for it. There’s always opportunities that come out of nowhere, and we can jump on them. Next Sing was just an idea founded by a group of very musically-minded folks living together, and I happened to come across it at a time that was perfect for my experience level. Had I not been part of the Fugues before, I never would have had the confidence to lead acts and teach others, but the opportunity presented itself in a way that wasn’t burdensome given the commitments I had already made. There’s always opportunities to take a tried and true concept (college a cappella) and apply new ways of doing it (having a lot of members and allowing them to pick between acts that they want to do, rather than making everyone do everything).</p>
<hr><p>This was a long blog post, which has been revised nearly every semester since junior fall as things changed and new circumstances presented themselves. Perhaps long sagas will still be recounted on this blog in the future, but hopefully getting this off my chest will allow me to write and reflect more on my life.</p>
<p>Until later,<br>
