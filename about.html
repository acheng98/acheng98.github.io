				<p>I’m Anthony Cheng, a fifth year PhD candidate and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">GRFP</a>) Fellow in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/">Engineering and Public Policy (EPP)</a> Department of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) under the direction of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/erica-rh-fuchs.html">Dr. Erica Fuchs</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/valerie-karplus.html">Dr. Valerie Karplus</a>, and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/jeremy-j-michalek.html">Dr. Jeremy Michalek</a>. I previously graduated from MIT in 2020, where I majored in Materials Science and Engineering (with a focus on Entrepreneurship and Materials Commercialization), with a double minor in Computer Science and Energy Studies. In MIT-speak, that’s 3A-15 with a double minor in 6-3 and ESM.</p>

				<p><b>I am on the job market for Fall 2026! Please reach out if you think I could be a fit for your institution or organization.</b> My academic CV is linked in the navigation bar.</p>

				<p>My general research interests lie around understanding manufacturing and commercialization of clean technologies needed in the energy transition. My most recent projects have focused on vulnerabilities, incentives, and interventions in battery electric vehicle material supply chains, with our paper 'Electric vehicle battery chemistry affects supply chain disruption vulnerabilities' <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46418-1">published in Nature Communications</a> and a second paper 'US industrial policy may reduce electric vehicle battery supply chain vulnerabilities and influence technology choice' <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01649-w">published in Nature Energy</a>. I’m generally interested in energy systems, industrial processes, and electric power, having previously researched decarbonization in the industrial sector as an <a href="https://urop.mit.edu/research-exploration/eloranta/about/prior-fellowship-recipients">MIT Eloranta Fellow</a>. I am also honored to be a 2024-2025 fellow in both the Resources for the Future's <a href="https://www.rff.org/topics/transportation/critical-minerals/critical-minerals-research-lab/">Critical Minerals Research Lab</a> as well as in the <a href="https://www.macroenergysystems.org/about-us">Macro Energy Systems Society</a>, and I’m proud to now serve on the board of the latter.</p> 

				<p>I care a lot about helping others, both on a “micro” community level and a “macro” global world problems level. I'm proud of my work in Carnegie Mellon's <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/about-the-gsa/index.html">Graduate Student Assembly</a> as the Vice President of Campus Affairs, advocating for graduate students in all non-academic and non-social settings (e.g. transportation, healthcare, parents and families, sustainability, dining, public art, etc.) between January 2023 and October 2024. In my undergraduate studies, I appreciate having the opportunity to lead <a href="http://startup.mit.edu/">StartLabs</a> (MIT’s undergrad entrepreneurship club) and <a href="https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/residences/macgregor-house">MacGregor House</a> (my living community).</p>

				<p>In the past, I’ve <a href="https://www.cee.org/news/eighty-four-high-school-students-selected-and-participating-32nd-research-science-institute-mit">been selected as one</a> of the nation’s top high school STEM students, <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/intel-isef-2015-grand-award-winners/">presented at International Science Fairs</a>, represented the United States at the <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2011/07/27/russian-team-takes-home-international-geography-bee-medal/">National Geographic World Championships</a>, performed as a piano soloist with the <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=50327473&itype=cmsid">Utah Symphony</a> and at locations like Carnegie Hall, and been recognized with <a href="https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/awards/">a</a> <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/psp/2016/scholars.pdf">number</a> <a href="https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/blog/2016-coca-cola-scholars/">of</a> <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2016/3/11/20584691/2016-sterling-scholar-award-winners-geared-up-to-solve-world-s-problems#anthony-cheng-of-hillcrest-high-school-the-mathematics-category-sterling-scholar-receives-the-general-sterling-scholar-award-during-the-2016-sterling-scholar-awards-ceremony-in-salt-lake-city-thursday-march-10-2016">awards</a>. I also enjoy <a href="./things.html">reading</a>, <a href="./projects.html">creative media</a>, <a href="https://www.slcdunk.com/search?q=acheng98">blogging about the NBA</a>, beatboxing and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qCbU7Ls_Nk8k7twHoEJbzLnqWh85LR8u">a cappella</a> (having won awards for <a href="https://varsityvocals.com/results-page/?fwp_year=2023&fwp_venue=university-of-pittsburgh">Best Vocal Percussion</a> and <a href="https://varsityvocals.com/results-page/?fwp_year=2024&fwp_venue=university-of-pittsburgh">Best Arrangement</a> at the "real-life" version of Pitch Perfect), making discord bots, and other elements of the arts<a href="https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/018/899/936.jpg">.</a></p>
